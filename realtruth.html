this is from 404
<br><br>
before i say anything, id like to say that none of this is exaggerated, but may be taken from a different perspective of what tanner was thinking
<br><br>
tanner and i have done this together (is what i thought) he was the face, and i did a lot of the back end with him. he would make music, and perform, while i would do the lights, directing, editing, production, and more for completely free. this was because he was my friend, and i love my friends a lot and want to see them thrive. i got him FL studio, presets, a $1500 computer, let him come over to my house to record with expensive gear. i would use thousands of dollars on cameras, audio, and more to make his music as good as possible. i'm not saying i did all the work, and i wasn't forced into this. i felt unappriciated because tanner and i would do things together all the time, and it felt like we were doing this together. almost like yeat and bnyx relationship. i understand where he came from here, wanting the distrokid access, and his dad wanted to have access too. im not sure but based on him removing me from spotify for artists, he may have tried to kick me from distrokid too but doesnt know i have access from my google lol. however, thats not cool removing me without notice when i thought i was your manager (as he expressed this heavily) and even when he complained like my name being in his spotify bio too much and i removed every trace of it, it recently at least, has felt like hes been using me.
<br><br>
like i stated earlier, i did all his lights at concerts and more, again i never wanted a payment, i wanted to see him succeed. but we were best friends where he would stay over at my house, or we'd go out and do sumn, but recently, he's been hanging out with new friends -not a problem, i want him to- the problem is he completely ghosted me. i mean straight up ghosted me to these people. wouldnt reply, but only texted me to get his music stuff. which i gave him. i own this website. i bought it. its in MY name, so i will put this here. he fired me (i think i was fired because i was never told) and he became fake, only asking me for music stuff, beats, lights for concerts. like no, you wont give me basic friendship needs anymore, so why would i do this.
<br><br>
sure, i've done my wrongs. but they were in light spirit, and didnt affect him negatively. i would call him names or play fight as jokes as we have been friends for almost 4 years, and theres no room for him to talk about names, as he often calls people that we know in common the same names i will call him.
<br><br>
basically, seraphim treats people hypocritically, expecting people to treat him like God, but never treat another person the same way. i know he jokes, but the way he has become so fake lately is unbelievable. i plan to run a business one day and want to become wealthy. not billions, but a few million would be amazing. i dont want a fake friend in my life who will take from me just because i have money. again, i never wanted payment for this stuff but he is getting greedy with what he is able to do. i believe whole heartedly that he has amazing abilities, however; greed is going to be his downfall if he doesn't look at what hes destroyed to reach fame. he's not chasing God. i'll be the first to admit it
<br><br><br>

if the website updates, this page disappears, or its not deleted on august 1st 2025, we may have made up. i will still be friends with him but i'm not giving away my time when i can't get a thank you in return. until he learns he's greedy and fixes it, this is the last you'll see of 404 in the music industry. i luv yall, follow your dreams. God help tanner.
